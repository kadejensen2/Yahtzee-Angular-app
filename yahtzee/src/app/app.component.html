        <h4>At the start of a turn, you will roll all 5 dice. Then you can roll some or all of the dice
          up to two more times, holding on to any dice you'd like to keep and rerolling the rest.
          The dice can be scored after any of the rolls, but scoring the dice ends the turn.
          Holding a die after one roll does not prevent if from being rolled again on a later roll.
          The goal is to try and score as high as you can in one of the thirteen categories shown on the score card.
          To score the dice, you select one of the categories on the scorecard.
          Each category can be scored only once per game. Categories can be filled in any order.
          You must score the dice even if it turns out that there are no good categories remaining to score in.
          Once a category is filled it may not be changed.
          <h3>Tips</h3>
          If you score more than 63 points on the number section you will earn an extra 35 points.
          A second Yahtzee can be used as a joker for any of the categories, given that its number value has already been scored (Ex. a yahtzee of 2s can't be used as a joker if you haven't scored the 2s category yet).
          Additional Yahtzees will grant you 100 bonus points if you have scored 50 in the Yahtzee category.
          Additional rules and conditions for scoring can be found <a href="https://winning-moves.com/images/YAHTZEERULESv2.pdf" target="blank">here.</a>
